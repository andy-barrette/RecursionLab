# RecursionLab
Fractal generator based on geometric recursion

Recursion Lab Version 0.2.01 (2012)
Created by Andy Barrette



Known Bugs/Mistakes:
- Discoloration of renders when Blending=0.  Images appear to be in 2 bit color.
- Horizontal squashing of recursion plot on some Windows machines.
- Plot is zoomable and panable when Help tool is enabled.
- Help text shifts position when mouse is in lower half of screen.
- Program freezes when render is started (and unfreezes when render finishes).
- Point motion boundaries are not maintained at high speed levels.
- Point motion should be constrained so as to roughly preserve the size of the fractal.
- Typos in help and info texts.

Future Features:
- Enhanced recursion algorithm.
- Shapes and Images can be added to the plot for reiteration.
- Delete key enabled.
- Highlighting within text fields enabled.
- Buttons and fields organized within collapsable/expandable panels.
- Render Progress bar and Cancel button.
- Separate Color Density values for each type of color dependency.
- Enhanced blending that will fill empty space in render.
